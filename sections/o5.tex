% \emph{5. You can explain the difference between communicating with an I/O device using memory mapped I/O or I/O instructions.}

\textbf{Memory mapped I/O}: A device's memory is mapped to the CPU's memory address space, ie. the device's memory is manipulated in exactly the same way as regular memory.

\textbf{I/O instructions}: Processes can use I/O instructions, such as the \texttt{IN} and \texttt{OUT} instructions in the \texttt{x86} instruction set. Those two transfer data between I/O devices and registers/memory through the I/O ports of the CPU.
