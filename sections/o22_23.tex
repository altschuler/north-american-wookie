\subsection{Busy wait}
Uses the full resource of the thread to stay alive and continuously check for the critical section lock to become available.

Pseudo:
\begin{cpp}
int locked = 0;

void mutex_enter() {
  while (locked) { /* noop */ }
  locked = 1;
}

void mutex_exit() {
  locked = 0;
}
\end{cpp}

Usage
\begin{cpp}
mutex_enter();
/* critical section */
mutex_exit();
\end{cpp}

It is worth noting that one can also use the \texttt{TSL} (Test Set and Lock) or \texttt{CAS} (Compare And Swap) instructions to implement this.

\subsection{Blocking}
Puts the process to sleep and wakes it up from another process. Semaphores and monitors can do this. TODO: more?
